# Strengths:

- High Accuracy in Document Similarity Detection : 
		- Effectively identifies and compares content across documents to detect duplicates or closely related entries.

- Seamless User Experience : 
		- Smooth and responsive interface with animations designed to enhance overall 	workflow and user engagement.

- Cost-Effective Operations:
		- Document processing (including vectorization, deduplication, and classification) for a 10-page document costs approximately $0.08.
		- Answer extraction from a document costs around $0.02.

- Efficient Resource Management:
		- Built-in mechanisms prevent unnecessary AI calls by detecting and halting operations when critical issues arise (e.g., missing parameters, duplicate content).

Areas for Improvement:

- Expanded User Controls: 
        - Enable users to edit document names, adjust personal settings, and manage preferences for a more customized experience.

- Optimized Prompt Handling: 
        - Further reduce AI usage costs through improved prompt engineering and reuse strategies.

Missing Document Detection: 
        - Introduce features to identify gaps or absent documents within a dataset or expected corpus.

Document Teasers for Stakeholders: 
        - Generate concise, engaging previews of documents to showcase content for potential acquirers or investors.

Multilingual Support: 
        - Extend platform capabilities to support document processing and interactions in multiple languages.
